# freecodecamp-portfolio-page
The last project to get the certification for Responsive Web Design at freeCodeCamp.

This is not the best project, but I'm proud of what I managed to complete. There's some features lacking, such as the project square isn't really working correctly (it doesn't stick in the center of the viewport).

Also I did not complete the footer or contact sections, which wasn't that good honestly. However, I needed to move on.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, all the best for 2024!
